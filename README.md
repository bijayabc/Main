- Hi, I’m Bijay and I am from Nepal. I am currently a sophomore at Caldwell University and I aspire to be an exceptional software programmer. I want to learn about how computers work in a very detailed way and I want to educate myself to be able to write amazing programs to make computers do amazing things. 
- It has only been two years since I started this journey and I am very excited but also nervous. Excited because of the unlimited potential in this field and nervous that I'm falling behind or I'm not where I'm supposed to be by now. At the same time, I am proud of myself because I've come a long way from where I started. I hope I'll learn and become more confident as I go.
- I’m currently learning python. I have done a few projects in this language. I am also working on my CS50 journey to get the CS50 certificate provided by Harvard. It has been very insightful in giving me more insight about the basics of Computer Science as a whole.
- I’m looking for internships to get real world experience and to test myself.
